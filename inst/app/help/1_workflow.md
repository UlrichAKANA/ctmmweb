### Sidebar Menus
- Each item in sidebar is a step in workflow.
  - Bolded item with green icon are core steps. Each core step need previous core steps as precondition (except Map can be used right after Visualization, just without home range part).
  - Italic item with blue icon are optional steps. They require previous core steps as precondition, but optional steps themselves are independent to each other.
