**Provide information to reproduce the bug**
- The most important information in a bug report is to make it reproducible for author, that's the only way we can check and fix the problem.
- There is a `save progress` button on left side menu, which can save lots of information(package version, report of every step) and your data as a single zip file. Please provide the saved zip file if possible. You can send the zip or share a downloadable link to my email `xhdong@umd.edu`.
